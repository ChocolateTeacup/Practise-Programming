Programming Challenge: “Parse and evaluate simple math word problems returning the answer as an integer.” 

Meant to calculate the answer to phrases like “What is 5 plus 3 times 2 divided by 4?” 

Its main focus is on trying to accept natural language in the console input. 

In order to accept as large as possible a range of phrases, it also cheerfully accepts nonsense input. For example:  “Adders are Slytherin? Multinomial 1 2 3 4” gives “9” as an answer. Why? Adders begins with “Add” (to accommodate different declinations of add), so that operator adds the first two numbers. “are” and “Slytherin” are nothing, as is the question mark, so it simply ignores this. Multinomial is recognised as beginning with “Mult” so clearly it’s a multiplication between the result of the first sum and the third number, giving the answer 9. It doesn’t have any more operators, so it ignores the 4.

Only integer numbers are currently accepted (full stops and commas are stripped). 
Large numbers are accepted. (Within Java’s double range). 
Negative numbers are accepted, but there must not be a space between the “-” and the number, or the “-” will be stripped. 
Numbers must be entered as digits, so “13” not “thirteen”. 
Will not return the answer as an integer if the answer isn’t an integer (so 5 divided by 2 is 2.5). 
Only inputting one number will give that number in return. Inputting no numbers 
Query can be essentially arbitrarily long.
